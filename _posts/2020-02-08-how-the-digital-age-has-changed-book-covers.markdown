## How the Digital Age Has Changed Book Covers

Books, described by David Pearson, are artefacts and time capsules preserving a certain kind of human knowledge (Ojeda, Lommen, 2016: 182). And for a long time, the **cover** of the book has functioned as a gateway into this knowledge. A vital marketing tool, and a part of communicating the book’s identity. But, like many traditional media, the book and its cover has been immensely impacted with the rise of the digital age. The turn to digital has not only introduced a new platform, but also changed the way book covers are produced, how they look, and how they function.

### Production

The digital age has made the process of producing book covers both **easier** and **cheaper**. For example, by removing the costs of printing through the possibility of e-books. Before, book covers often faced compromise within production quality due to high costs. Also, from what used to include commissioning illustrations or photographers, book covers can now be cheaply produced through access to stock photos, fonts and Photoshop (Kreider, 2013).

What also differs from print book covers is the opportunity for **development**. Printed books as artefacts are complete pieces of work. Digital books are _continuous_, constantly redefining the notion of “completeness” by providing the opportunity for updating the content. This has also influenced the book cover. Once _printed_, the book cover is set in ‘stone’ without the possibility of change. The _digital_ cover however, has the chance to be constantly redefined.


### Function

Now more than ever, book covers have to **perform**. Instead of merely functioning as the face of the book, they also have to be visually loud. With thousands of pictures and information available online, books are more than just competing with each other in Brick-and-Mortar stores. They are competing on the Internet, with the thousands and thousands of books and other forms of entertainment that are all trying to grab the attention of the consumer. Additionally, as described by Craig Mod, the book cover is competing with other data and information. In his article ‘Hack the Cover’ he states:

> ‘The cover image may help quickly ground us, but our eyes are drawn by habit to number and quality of reviews. We’re looking for metrics other than images — real metrics — not artificial marketing signifiers. Blurbs from humans.’ (2013)

Online it is not just the visual appeal that determines a purchase, but also data like reviews and ratings.

### Look

The digital age has also changed the **look** of book covers. With inventions like the Kindle, iPad or iPhone, book covers have shrunk, down to a mere postage stamp size in order to fit the small screens. On Amazon, they are placed next to the other title information. With limited space there is limited impact.

However, this has also provided new opportunities. Publishers have had to adapt to the digital change by finding a way for book covers to look great in miniature. Now, there is a bigger focus on cover aesthetics than ever before. Book covers are bolder and cleaner. More aesthetically pleasing in order to look good on all devices. Especially on social media, which has boosted the change in looks.
