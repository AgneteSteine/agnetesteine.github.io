### Welcome to my blog!

My name is Agnete Steine, I'm 23 years old and I come from a small town located in the north of Norway. I'm currently studying Publishing Media in Oxford.

This blog was created for the purpose of one of my modules, called _Digital Product_. Here I will post written articles on all kinds of aspects within the digital publishing world. There will also be a recipe section where a collection of delicious recipes will be added.
