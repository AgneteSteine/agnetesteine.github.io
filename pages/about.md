### Welcome to my blog!
My name is Agnete Steine, I'm 23 years old and I come from a small town located in the north of Norway. I'm currently studying Publishing Media in Oxford.

This blog was created for the purpose of one of my modules, called _Digital Product_. Here, I will post written articles on all kinds of aspects within the digital publishing world. There will also be a food section where delicious recipes will be added.

This file is saved inside the _pages_ folder and is saved as _about.md_ . Any file in this folder (as long as it has  the YAML header) will automatically show up as a link in the header bar.

You should use **markdown**to write this text and this will automatically be converted to `HTML`.
