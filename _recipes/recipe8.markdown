- 8 tablespoons peanut butter

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Pre-heat oven on 160 degrees celsius.
2. Put baking sheet in a cake tin of approximately 35 x 25 cm.
3. Whip the eggs and sugar in a kitchen machine. Add cacao powder and oil while the machine is going.
4. Add flour and whip gently until you have an even mix.
5. Put the mixture into the cake tin.
6. Fill a casserole with approx. 1/3 parts of water. Bring the water to a boil and lower the heat to low. Find a bowl of glass or aluminium that can be inside the casserole. Make sure that the water does not boil underneath the bowl.
7. Put peanut butter into the bowl. Let the peanut butter slowly melt. When it is melted take the bowl of the heat.
8. Use a spoon and pour the peanut butter in large "waves" over the cake tin. Use a fork to even out the peanut butter and to make patterns in the mixture.
9. Bake the brownies in the middle of the oven for about 20 minutes.
10. Cool down the cake and cut it into pieces before serving.
