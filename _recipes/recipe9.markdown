# Coffee Pecan Loaf

This classic version of a pecan loaf includes coffee for an added taste, and the result is a cake of wonderful texture and flavour. Perfect to serve alongside your morning tea or coffee. The pecan loaf is also freezer-friendly, so why not cut it in half and save some for later.
